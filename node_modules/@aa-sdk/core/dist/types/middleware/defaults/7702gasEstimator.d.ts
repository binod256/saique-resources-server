/**
 * A middleware function to estimate the gas usage of a user operation when using an EIP-7702 delegated account. Has an optional custom gas estimator.
 * This function is only compatible with accounts using EntryPoint v0.7.0, and the account must have an implementation address defined in `getImplementationAddress()`.
 *
 * @deprecated The EIP-7702 auth is now set in initUserOperation instead. This middleware is no longer necessary.
 *
 * @param {ClientMiddlewareFn} gasEstimator Optional custom gas estimator function
 * @returns {ClientMiddlewareFn} A function that takes user operation struct and parameters, estimates gas usage, and returns the user operation with gas limits.
