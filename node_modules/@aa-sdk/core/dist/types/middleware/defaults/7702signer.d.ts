/**
 * Provides a default middleware function for signing user operations with a client account when using EIP-7702 delegated accounts.
 * If the signer doesn't support `signAuthorization`, then this just runs the provided `signUserOperation` middleware.
 * This function is only compatible with accounts using EntryPoint v0.7.0, and the account must have an implementation address defined in `getImplementationAddress()`.
 *
 * @deprecated The EIP-7702 auth signature is now handled by the defaultUserOpSigner middleware. This middleware is no longer necessary.
 *
 * @param {ClientMiddlewareFn} [userOpSigner] Optional user operation signer function
 * @returns {ClientMiddlewareFn} A middleware function that signs EIP-7702 authorization tuples if necessary, and also uses the provided or default user operation signer to generate the user op signature.
