 * Predicts the address of a modular account V2 based on the provided parameters, which include factory address, salt, and implementation address. This function supports different types of accounts including "SMA", "MA", and "WebAuthn".
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { predictModularAccountV2Address } from "@account-kit/smart-contracts";
 *
 * const accountAddress = predictModularAccountV2Address({
 *   factoryAddress: "0xFactoryAddress" as Address,
 *   implementationAddress: "0xImplementation" as Address,
 *   salt: 0n,
 *   type: "SMA",
 *   ownerAddress: "0xOwner" as Address,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @param {PredictModularAccountV2AddressParams} params The parameters for predicting the modular account address, including `factoryAddress`, `salt`, `implementationAddress`, and additional properties based on the account type.
 * @returns {Address} The predicted address for the modular account V2.
